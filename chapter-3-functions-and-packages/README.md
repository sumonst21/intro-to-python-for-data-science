### Functions

### Familiar functions

Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: [print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) and [type()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type). You've also used the functions [str()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), [int()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), [bool()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) and floa[t()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of `3.0` and store the output as a new variable, `result`, you can use the following:

```py
result = type(3.0)
```

The general recipe for calling functions and saving the result to a variable is thus:

```py
output = function_name(input)
```
