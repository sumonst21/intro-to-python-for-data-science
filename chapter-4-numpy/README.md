# NumPy

NumPy is a Python package to efficiently do data science. Learn to work with the NumPy array, a faster and more powerful alternative to the list, and take your first steps in data exploration.

## Your First NumPy Array

In this chapter, we're going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of `numpy`, a powerful package to do data science.

A list `baseball` has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code here and there to create a `numpy` array from it?

 ** Instruction **
- Import the `numpy` package as `np`, so that you can refer to `numpy` with `np`.
- Use [np.array()](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name this array `np_baseball`.
- Print out the type of `np_baseball` to check that you got it right.
