## Your First NumPy Array
# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))


## Baseball players' height
# @pre_exercise_code
# height is available as a regular list
import pandas as pd
mlb = pd.read_csv(
    "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")
height = mlb['Height'].tolist()

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height: np_height
np_height = np.array(height)

# Print out np_height
print(np_height)

# Convert np_height to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)


## Baseball player's BMI
#@pre_exercise_code
# height and weight are available as regular lists
import pandas as pd
mlb = pd.read_csv(
    "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_python/baseball.csv")
height = mlb['Height'].tolist()
weight = mlb['Weight'].tolist()

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height with correct units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight with correct units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)
